Steps to install identity server
navigate to the folder where you want to install the template
install the duende templates using the following commands
dotnet new -i Duende.IdentityServer.Templates

select the inmemeory store option with the command below
dotnet new isinmem
that would create the in-memory project.

For this, We started from scratch
create an empty project -> dotnet new web
from nugget, install the identity server package -> Duende.IdentityServer
builder.add identity server

to get the discovery document, /.well-known/openid-configuration

identity server needs to know the resources it protects and the clients that should have access to the resources, and the level of access that they have 
so define the resources we need to protects
and authentication for users can be done with identity server

// add the services we are trying to protect are the resources

for the services to be able to validate the token, we need to add jwt bearer authentication, this way the client sends the token to the services,
the service will have to validate the token, this is achieved with the help of jwt bearer authentication,
with this package in place, the service connects and sends a copy of the token to identity server to validate
